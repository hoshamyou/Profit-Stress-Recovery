# Profit-Stress-Recovery
A comprehensive Power BI project focusing on identifying loss-making products, evaluating profitability stress points, and simulating recovery through dynamic What-If analysis. Includes interactive visuals, KPI tracking, and scenario testing to support data-driven business decisions.

## Data Preparation

This report was built after performing proper data cleaning and data modeling.  
The dataset was prepared by cleaning raw data, handling inconsistencies, and defining the necessary relationships between tables to ensure accurate calculations and reliable insights.

# Power BI Sales Analysis Report

A comprehensive Power BI report analyzing product profitability, sales trends, and loss recovery scenarios.  
This report leverages advanced analytics and What-If simulations to guide business decisions.

---

## Objective

The report aims to:
- Identify unprofitable products and subcategories.
- Measure and visualize profitability across regions, categories, and time.
- Simulate price adjustments (1–20%) to explore recovery scenarios.
- Provide decision-driven insights without altering underlying sales data.

## Report Structure

1. **Overview Page** – High-level KPIs including revenue, cost, quantity, and overall profit margin.
2. **Loss Analysis Page** – Focuses on negative-profit products and subcategories.
3. **What-If Simulation Page** – Interactively test price change scenarios and see impact on margins.
4. **Time Intelligence & Trends** – Track MTD, QTD, YTD, and historical comparisons.

## How to Use the What-If Simulation

Use the **Price Change slider** to simulate **percentage-based price increases**.  

All visuals update dynamically to show:
- Which subcategories recover
- Which products remain unprofitable
- How total losses evolve under each scenario

⚠️ Note: This is a simulation only; sales data is **not** actually changed.
